Problem is with so many cherry picking info.

@AnnGerSmy @JustineMulliga Covid deaths have surpassed 2020; after the vaccine was implemented.

And an area in Ireland w/ 95% vaccination had giant spikes in Covid cases recently.

@TheRealAndrew_ Why do people think horse dewormer kills covid?  Because they're too freakin' stupid to live, probably.
