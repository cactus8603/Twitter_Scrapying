@IrfanDhalla Is it time to stop using the term vaccinated if they have had 1, 2 or 3 shots? If the vaccine does not prevent a persons from getting COVID or spreading COVID then what is the purpose?

@hadeslinnaeus Yep I know, proportionally much greater   But here's the point. All their statistics are drivel. Their diagnosis of Covid and attribution of "cases" are complete nonsense. But these are "their statistics" and they clearly show hospitals aren't overwhelmed by the unvaxxed.
