@na_croi @stiofandawson @LibbyLibbys61 @BigJoe15282069 @BBCNewsNI That’s not the argument i’m making though lad. The whole point is that this bloke said that a majority of covid patients are unvaccinated. Which isn’t true.
@astaines @TJRyan_77 We’re also paying for govs failure to implement even NPHETs unambitious plans either timely, completely or both. 

Make no mistake, even if NPHET embraced a zero Covid strategy, this government will continue to serve their masters and deny reality itself.
